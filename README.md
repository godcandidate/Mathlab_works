# My DSP Lab Works (MATLAB)
This is my personal repository for the MATLAB scripts I use in my Digital Signal Processing (DSP) lab class.

## What's Here?

Here you'll find various MATLAB scripts I wrote for my DSP lab assignments. These scripts cover topics like:

- Generating signals (sine, cos, etc.)
- Filtering signals (low-pass, high-pass, etc.)
- Analyzing signals in the frequency domain (FFT)
- Maybe even some more

## Using the Scripts:

These scripts are mainly for my reference, but feel free to take a look!

## Keep in Mind:

You might need to modify the scripts to fit your specific lab assignments.
Basic knowledge of DSP is helpful to understand what the scripts do.

Happy Learning
